          </h3>
          <p>
            The idea of building a B2B marketplace, came to us a few years ago.
            Experiencing the process of buying and selling in bulk: footwear,
            apparel etc... since early 2002 we’ve encountered issues and
            restrictions , we also faced lots of question from sellers and
            buyers, shipping issues etc... But at the end of this journey, we
            are now providing answers and solutions that will help our network
            and partners!

          <h3>Always the same issue through the years </h3>
          <p>
            Many years have past of doing this bulk /wholesale trading
            business... And it is always the same questions that came to us from
            our suppliers: “Hey can you move apparel? I have too much of this
            brand etc...”, or “Can you buy any accessories?”, “Can you move
            soccer shoes?”, “I received another shipment of this model ;can you
            buy more or help me move more now?” etc... Well the answer was: “We
            don’t have any clients for those items, or let me ask around”

          <h3>Utopia</h3>
          <p>
            In a utopian marketplace, the best option would be to move a bunch
            of footwear/apparel or else, in bulk (one shot), to: another
            reseller, store or wholesaler somewhere on planet earth. Well, there
            are no B2B marketplaces anywhere that deal with: limited/ hyped
            goods, or a marketplace where stores (with no brand account) &
            reseller could buy from (in bulk prices footwear, apparel,
            accessories) without any boundaries or questions! So let's try and
            create that platform: so other store owners & resellers/wholesalers
            worldwide could profit from!
          </p>

          <h3>Reality</h3>
          <p>
            Stores are flooded with quantities of the same items, so what do
            they do? They flip them on well known resell platform/marketplace;
            and we are all very familiar with these marketplaces... . How can
            you sell some Yeezys or Nike, when buyers/bidders are offering a
            price of 20-35% under retail? Simple, if you are not the store
            yourself or a person who bought them at roughly 35% to 40% off
            retail... then forget it!
          </p>
          <p>So, as a store owner, we see 3 options :</p>
          <p>
            1. Sell all your sleeping inventory on certain platforms one by one
            etc. (and for sure , some models will not even sell ...so it’s a
            loss).Shipping will take a while, and you are wasting time &
            labor...
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-md-6 mt-5 ">
          <img src="mechine2.svg" className="img-fluid" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div className="col-md-6 mt-5 pt-5">
          <p>
            2. Wholesale them to some entity or reseller you trust.But again
            they might only want to buy the good and the average stuff, that
            they can flip.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Last but not least : Sell them on a platform in bulk anonymously,
            with or without a discount ! Allowing your Hyped or general
            merchandise release inventory to reach multiple stores/resellers in
            the USA and worldwide . Forget the classic individual B2C (business
            to consumer) model and , aim at other stores/ wholesalers .The Hype
            around the footwear, Apparel, Accessory resell market is wide and
            active! There are many options out there that need to be exploited!

            By using this platform, nobody knows who the sellers are. Anonymity

          <h5>BRAND INTEGRITY</h5>
          <p>
            Reputable brands dislike to see their product sell for significantly
            under retail and doing so, may cause stores to lose their accounts.

          <p>
            Freedom for Stores/Resellers to list in bulk any inventory they want
            at any time they want! Inventory should sell faster this way! Better
            than offering a 10%-35% off coupons on their website and selling
            them one item at a time... let’s move the inventory ASAP! Stores are
            not museums: Boxes, tape, rent,electricity bill, payroll: those have
            a cost!
